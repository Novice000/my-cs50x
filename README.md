# CS50x Problem Sets

This repository contains my solutions to all problem sets from [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard University's introduction to computer science course offered through edX. CS50x covers a variety of computer science concepts, including algorithms, data structures, web development, and more.

## Overview

Each problem set folder includes my code for the assignment along with any necessary documentation. The problems in CS50x cover a range of topics:
- C programming
- Algorithms
- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and more)
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Databases (SQL)
- Python programming
- And more!

This repository is intended as a reference and study resource. Please do not copy solutions directly if you are currently taking CS50x, as that would violate the courseâ€™s academic honesty policy.

## Problem Sets

Each problem set has its own directory. The following is a list of problem sets included in this repository:

1. **Week 1** - C Basics and Mario
2. **Week 2** - Arrays and Caesar Cipher
3. **Week 3** - Algorithms and Sort
4. **Week 4** - Memory and Filter
5. **Week 5** - Data Structures and Speller
6. **Week 6** - Python and Sentimental
7. **Week 7** - SQL and Movies
8. **Week 8** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Homepage
9. **Week 9** - Flask and Finance

Each folder contains:
- Code solutions (`.c`, `.py`, `.sql`, etc.)
- Explanatory comments within the code
- Documentation (when applicable)

## Acknowledgments

Some portions of the code are provided by CS50 staff, including template code and certain helper functions required to complete the assignments. I have built upon these foundations as per the course guidelines.
